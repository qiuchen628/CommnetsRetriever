You have disappointed me so much in the last week. Seriously, we have bought all of or kitchen and laundry room appliances with Samsung and we were so happy with you until our washer quit working and so did your customer service. We have had our washer now for 3 years and 5 days ago, in  the middle of a cycle it stopped working. I turned it off and when trying to turn it back on nothing happened. After a lot of troubleshooting we decided to call Samsung. Samsung customer service told us that this sounds like a product malfunction and they will help us take care of it. Awesome! We Had originally bought a five year warranty on it but when HHGreg went out of business, our warranty disappeared. So when Samsung said we would be covered, it was such a relief. Customer service sent us to a company that would come out and service our washer for free. And that\u2019s where everything went downhill. The company that they got a hold of then told us that this would not be free and that they possibly could not do it at all. So we called Samsung customer service back and told them what happened. The first person we spoke to about this had a very nasty attitude. The next person was hearing our problem, but when we told them that we were originally told this would be fixed and that Samsung would take care of it, they claimed that they would \u201cpull the call to find out\u201d. We decided that since me and my wife both work as essential employees With the Indiana Department of Corrections, and the possibility and risk of bringing COVID-19 back to our three kids from our inmate population is very high, that we could not wait much longer to not be able to wash our work clothes. We began calling third-party repair services. However every local repair service That we have around us, does not work on Samsung appliances. (on another note, if we would\u2019ve known that no one likes to work on Samsung appliances and it would be such a difficult fix, we would\u2019ve never bought Samsung in the first place.) so out of options for repairs, we feel defeated. Today we received a phone call back from Samsung who informed us that they cannot find the \u201csupposed conversation\u201d (yes she was extremely rude and acted like we made it up) that we originally had where Samsung told us they would take care of it for us. How convenient... Samsung you have seriously let me down. Especially with how the world is today and the importance of cleanliness. Me and my wife were dependent on you just like you are dependent on us while we leave our family to work in a prison and take care of your loved ones. All we wanted was someone to come out and look at this washer. No one around us will do it because of your name. We\u2019re not asking for anything for free, but we are asking for common decency as your customers for you to help us figure out what we can do to get this problem fixed. Because if it is a product malfunction such as a recall then why are we being treated like we made up the fact that someone told us that we would be taken care of and helped.

The kindness goes to every area of the store, because the cashiers make every attempt to ask if I found everything I was looking for during my shopping experience.

I have not gone for about a month.  \n\nBefore the pandemic, I was going less frequently just due to your new worthless paper cups in New England Winter.  I bought several sizes of your attempts at thermos type containers.  But carrying them is not always convenient.  Selling the wrong ounce  sizes does not help either.  You should only be selling container sizes of coffee sizes  available.  And there should be a discount for using your containers. There is, but NONE of your employees no how to deal with it.   Regardless. Can\u2019t bring in containers anymore anyway.  So we are stuck with the paper cups to transfer into a container to keep it hot.

The newest Dunkin has a covered front counter display as it should have always been.  But it is still open air in the rear of the case.  \n\nThen the sandwiches and all other items are not cooked.  They arrive pre-cooked and they simply assemble and reheat in a microwave.  \n\nAll bakery items, donuts, muffins, bagels etc. must be pre wrapped and arrive to you double wrapped.  There\u2019s no way I am eating an open air bagel put in a bag with a multi handled plastic disc of cream cheese with a loose plastic knife to put it on myself... etc.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t going to work.  Considering we have so many trump Covidiots spreading the virus because their moron messiah tells them to protest so he can just focus in money instead of people.   \n\nMaybe it will be safe to return when trump is removed.

Here are the lyrics:\nDon't stay awake for too long\r\nDon't go to bed\r\nI'll make a cup of coffee for your head\r\nI'll get you up and going out of bed\r\nYeah\r\nI don't wanna fall asleep\r\nI don't wanna pass away\r\nI been thinking of our future 'cause I'll never see those days\r\nI don't know why this has happened\r\nBut I probably deserve it\r\nI tried to do my best\r\nBut you know that I'm not perfect\r\nI been praying for forgiveness\r\nYou've been praying for my health\r\nWhen I leave this Earth\r\nHoping you'll find someone else\r\n'Cause yeah, we still young there's so much we haven't done\r\nGetting married, start a family\r\nWatch your husband with his son\r\nI wish it could be me\r\nBut I won't make it off this bed\r\nI hope I go to heaven\r\nSo I see you once again\r\nMy life was kinda short\r\nBut I got so many blessings\r\nHappy you were mine\r\nIt sucks that it's all ending\r\nDon't stay awake for too long\r\nDon't go to bed\r\nI'll make a cup of coffee for your head\r\nI'll get you up and going out of bed (yeah, ayy)\r\nAnd I, don't stay awake for too long\r\nDon't go to bed\r\nI'll make a cup of coffee for your head\r\nI'll get you up and going out of bed (ayy, yeah)\r\nIt won't be like this for too long\r\nIt won't break me down\r\nNothing feels the same when you're so far away\r\nThe world might be strange but it's a beautiful place\r\nIf we can make it through tomorrow\r\nThere'll be brighter times\r\nPhotographs of you will get me through today\r\nThe time we spend apart will be a memory someday\r\nDon't stay awake for too long\r\nDon't go to bed\r\nI'll make a cup of coffee for your head\r\nI'll get you up and going out of bed\r\nAnd I, don't stay awake for too long\r\nDon't go to bed\r\nI'll make a cup of coffee for your head\r\nI'll get you up and going out of bed\n\nAnd here is the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJPMnTXl63E", "They really put a song about depression and suicide over a donut commercial \u2620\ufe0f", "@0:07 The little girl pretending to work the drive thru window is too dam adorable.", "Lmao could've picked a better song to fit but you chose a song that was mainly based around the idea of death, hence the name \"death bed\".

I even put up signs telling customers to wait for the current person at the register to start to leave before unloading items onto the belt, and those were quickly removed by management.

The video viewer stops watching the given advertisement in general after 3 seconds. The advertiser is a fan of watching the entire advertisement. At this stage, no changes are required for the channel owner. However, a new point of view is needed for the advertiser and the audience that is the subject of the advertisement. Such a proposal would be satisfactory for both the advertiser and the audience. In addition to the existing advertising concept, a new account type must be created for both the advertiser and the audience. The main concept of the new concept is the determination of the fee according to the duration of the watch. The fee to be charged from the advertiser is determined for each minute watched. Again, the fee to be paid to the audience is determined for every minute of the advertisement he / she watches. This account type is opened for those who want it in addition to the existing accounts. It would not be compelling for those who want to continue in the old situation. For account holders who want to earn a fee by watching ads as an extra, a special section of their video is created for those who open a paid account.

We have all broken the moral law and deserve his wrath and judgement. \n\nThe Gospel: \n\nAt the same time the Father is so rich in mercy and loves us so much that he sent his Son in the flesh 2000 years ago, who lived a sinless life on our behalf, was gruesomely tortured, nailed to the cross, and mocked by his own creation. He died a horrific death in place of US sinners, and rose from the dead 3 days later proving he is the Great I Am. He paid the fine for our death sentence on the cross thus satisfying God's justice, setting us free from sin and the Law. Once we realize our sinful nature,\u00a0 we must repent for our sins, and put our full trust in the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ like you'd put faith in a parachute. Do this and you will be born again. He will give you the Holy Spirit which will live in you, eternal life in a united heaven and earth, a new heart that loves righteousness, and relationship with God will be made right, not by our good works or observance of the law, but by his AMAZING GRACE and mercy. Your sins will be instantly washed away and you'll be a new creature in Christ. That is His promise. This is a free gift from God.\u00a0 Humbly ask him to reveal himself to you. Think about it.

Eg hugsa ikkje ein einaste ting fr\u00e5 i g\u00e5r, men det er ikkje viktig. Eg m\u00e5 finne ut korleis eg ska overleva p\u00e5 denne \u00f8yde \u00f8ya. Fyrst s\u00e5 m\u00e5 eg finne ut om det er noko liv som eg kan f\u00e5 n\u00e6ring fr\u00e5. Eg ser nokon m\u00e5ker som sirklar over meg, men de blir det vanskeleg \u00e5 f\u00e5 noko fr\u00e5. Eg kan ser rundt meg helt til eg merkar ein kasse rett ved meg. Eg tar den opp og der st\u00e5r det \u201c denne boksen gir deg 3 ting du sp\u00f8r om\u201d. Eg m\u00e5tte tenkje raskt. Eg begynte \u00e5 bli svolten. Men eg har to val. Eg kan enten f\u00e5 ein b\u00e5t og dra fr\u00e5 denne \u00f8ya, eller eg kan f\u00e5 meg ein b\u00e5t og komme meg til n\u00e6rmaste land. Eg ser p\u00e5 \u00f8ya og den er ikkje s\u00e5 liten, men heller ikkje for stor. Det er tre omr\u00e5der her. Et skogomr\u00e5de, et vann og et stein omr\u00e5de. Disse er alle omringt av minst 10 meter med sand. Eg har tre ting eg kan f\u00e5, men eg trenger ikkje vann, men noko \u00e5 f\u00e5 mat med. S\u00e5 det fyrste \u00f8nsket mitt er ei fiskestong. Eg fiskar heile dagen og m\u00e5 grille fiskene eg fik. Eg veit ikkje korleis man tenner et b\u00e5l med hendene, s\u00e5 eg \u00f8nsker meg ein tennstav. Tennstaven han ikkje g\u00e5 tom s\u00e5 det er vel det smartaste valet. Eg griller fiskene spisar litt og leggjar meg p\u00e5 litt gras. Eg vaknar av en fugl som ser p\u00e5 meg. Det er en papeg\u00f8ye! Eg ser lenge p\u00e5 den, men reiser meg for \u00e5 hente litt vann. Papeg\u00f8yen st\u00e5r der framleis. Ser ikkje ut som at den eiar frykt. Eg strekkjer ut handa mi, og den bitar litt og hopper p\u00e5. Eg setter den p\u00e5 skuldra, og gir den litt mat. Den har en fin gr\u00f8nfarge med en r\u00f8d hale. Eg gir den litt fisk og eg g\u00e5r for \u00e5 fiske, men papeg\u00f8yen bier meg i \u00f8ret. Den hopper ned og ser mot stein omr\u00e5de. Eg g\u00e5r sakte mot havet igjen, men da springer papeg\u00f8yen og bitar og drar i buksene mine. Eg g\u00e5r videre mot steinane, og da ser eg det. Tusenvis av krystallar! Nokon er like stor som meg sj\u00f8lv! Eg ska bli rik tenkjer eg. S\u00e5 eg brukar mitt siste \u00f8nske p\u00e5 ein stor b\u00e5t med full tank. Etter et par timar med krystall\u00f8fting. G\u00e5r eg om bord med papeg\u00f8yen og vi begynnar \u00e5 k\u00f8yre mot nord. Eg setter p\u00e5 autopilot og g\u00e5r og leggar meg.  \r\n\r\nEg vaknar av at papeg\u00f8yen skriker og flakser.

Bacteria is there to feed off the WASTE or dead cells expelled by our body\n When you have an overload of dead cells and waste that is not being illuminated as it shoudl or fast enough, then the bacteria can get out of hand. The bodies response to dealing with that as well can cause uncomfortable symptoms.

There are so many millionaires here that if 40 of them gave a million each they could end homelessness.

The story begins with Holden at Pencey Prep School on his way to the house of his history teacher, Spencer, so that he can say goodbye. He reveals to the reader that he has been expelled for failing most of his classes. After he visits Spencer, he encounters his roommate, Ward Stradlater, who asks Holden to write an essay for English class for him while he goes on a date with a longtime friend of Holden\u2019s. Having agreed, Holden writes about the baseball glove of his younger brother, Allie, who died of\u00a0leukemia. When Stradlater returns, he tells Holden that the essay isn\u2019t good, and Holden gets angry when Stradlater refuses to say whether he had sex with his date. This causes Holden to storm out and leave Pencey for\u00a0New York City\u00a0a few days earlier than planned for\u00a0Christmas\u00a0break. Once he arrives in New York, he cannot go home, as his parents do not yet know that he has been expelled. Instead, he rents a room at the Edmont Hotel, where he witnesses some sexually charged scenes through the windows of other rooms. His loneliness then causes him to seek out human interaction, which he does at the Lavender Room, the hotel\u2019s nightclub. After interacting with some women there, he goes to another nightclub, only to leave after seeing his elder brother\u2019s ex-girlfriend.

Another thing is why is the government making such rash decisions? From what ive heard, the peak should be sometime around April 18th. That being said, why were schools closes for the rest of the year so quickly? There are other decisions they have made that they should not have made so early as well; however, i think trump is trying a lot more than some people are saying.

The first pre-production units were built in 2004. Evolution Series locomotives are equipped with either AC or DC traction motors, depending on the customer's preference. All are powered by the GE GEVO engine.[4]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Evolution Series was named as one of the \"10 Locomotives That Changed Railroading\" in the January 2009 issue of Trains Magazine.[5] It was the only locomotive introduced after 1972 to be included in that list.[5]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Evolution Series, mainly the ES44DC, ES44AC, and ET44AC, are some of the best-selling and most successful freight locomotives in United States history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nModels\r\n\r\nCurrently, six different Evolution Series models have been produced for the North American market. They are all six axle locomotives and have the wheel arrangement C-C (AAR classification) or Co'Co' (UIC classification), except for the ES44C4 which has an A1A-A1A wheel arrangement and the metric-gauge version developed for the Brazilian network ES43BBi which is B-B-B-B. All North American Evolution Series locomotives are equipped from the factory with a Nathan-Airchime K5HL-R2 \"Evolution\" airhorn, and most later models are equipped with a Graham-White 373 electronic bell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIdentifying features\r\n\r\nThe Evolution Series locomotives are visually similar to the AC4400CW, although small differences are evident. The most noticeable difference is the radiator section at the rear of the locomotive is larger to accommodate the GEVO's Air to air intercoolers. As with the AC6000CW, the radiators project beyond the end of the hood, though not to the same extent. The Evolution Series radiator does not protrude completely over the rear deck, but rather sits nearly flush with the rear of the engine hood. The ES44ACi and ES44DCi, however, do have radiators that extend in the same way as the AC6000CW, protruding out over the rear deck. Also, unlike previous GE locomotives, the grills under the radiator are at two different angles. The increase in radiator size is due to the necessity for greater cooling capacity in the locomotive in order to reduce emissions. The other major difference between the Evolution Series and earlier models are the vents below the radiators, which are larger than those on previous GE locomotives.[10] In addition, most, if not all, Evolution Series units have air conditioners mounted below the cab on the conductor's side.", "LOL, that lard-beast in the thumbnail probably won\u2019t survive even if she does stay home.\n\nLookit her neck, lol.

And also deciding what's advertisement friendly so ads get less publicity. Really YouTube go back to a time where we could monetize videos right after starting YouTube. Literally that's the only thing I care about YouTube because I'm poor and this virus has effected my family. I really wish YouTube would just go back to once you raise $100 you get your first paycheck. Please YouTube go back to those times where it was a lot more easier to make money. You really mostly care for the bigger YouTube channels and I'm still angry about this. I literally come from a poor family so I can't do much about my videos. I paid for better internet that's the most I could do to help my YouTube channel so I have actually put money into my channel. Please YouTube you want to help people out bring it back to the old days when I could monetize my videos without being so big. I don't care about the fame I just care about having a little bit of spending money at least. Really I would like to be able to have the money to focus on what I want. And get this if you're telling me just get a job I basically can't drive so it's pretty hard for me to leave the house. Like medically I'm not allowed to have a license because I deal with seizures.

So basically jobs I can do at home I have no skill in those jobs basically so the only skill I really got is YouTube. I know I'm talking too much but I was legitimately angry with YouTube when they made it so you had to have 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 watch time within a year. I was okay with 10,000 lifetime views then get monetize though at first I thought that was an acceptable goal. YouTube you want to help someone how about help the poorer population who are having to struggle with this virus the most by bringing back monetization right after starting YouTube. It does hurt small YouTube channels and it also hurts advertisements because their the ones not getting advertisements out there. I have notice less ads since YouTube did this and in all seriousness I don't like it myself because I don't know like if there's a product I should have or a new movie is coming out.

Add misting systems similar to Halo dust suppression systems or humidifiers and run a disinfectant solution through it. Restaurant booths can be closed off in plexiglass and surrounded with reflective pull down  curtains modeled after projector screens. This would be used between customers to sterilize the booth. The reflective surface will help you get under the table and in cracks. The mister will supress anything in the air. Then just wipe the table from time to time and leave a screen at each booth so customers can order from the booth. You can close off the kitchen behind glass to limit interaction between guests and staff. Drive through windows could be fitted with a drop box type system similar to the pick up windows at most pharmacies. Stores can close for the night and switch from daytime lighting to UV-C when closed. Install them at home too. The lights emit low levels of uv radiation, so expose should be limited. Use it in every room, but only when you are not in the room. Timer switches would help save energy. Please consider my suggestion.

One for the dryer that had been delivered and installed the previous successful delivery and one for my remaining appliances. She called back about an hour later and then informed me that there was no second delivery crew coming and I would have to cancel my order which means that I would lose my micro wave and range and oh yeah the fridge would not be delivered until 07/07. I said well can this order be changed to pick up, her response was yes. A few minutes later she informed me that the store was currently closed and I would have to wait to hear back in the morning. lol. Long horrible story short.

I asked had she understood what I said? I was calling today to let Kohls know why my payments were short and late even though I have no income coming in nor have I recieved my $1200 check from the government.
